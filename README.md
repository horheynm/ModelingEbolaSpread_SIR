# Predicting the spread of Ebola virus in Sierra Leone using an Epidemiological model

I used a SIR Rpidemiological model to predict how virus spreads in Sierra Leone, when Ebola was the hot topic in 2015. 
This was our (along with Hari, and Jacob) for our final project in the differential equations class. 
 
 We used codes to run simulations, since finding the exact solution for the sets of SIR equations is difficult. We used Runge Kutta method to approximate the solution. Here we assume the basic assumption of the SIR
 1. At least one person is infected in the population
 2. The population, rate of infection, rate of recovery, rate of death is fixed
 3. Once recovered, one cannot be re-infected
 
 We were surprised to see how closely it resembled the actual real-world scenario with a simple model. The trend of the model was very similar.
